        <h2>Shell Scripting and why?!</h2>
        <h5>Shell Scripting basics, Feb 7, 2023</h5>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Here you go guys I figured since I was forced to do this for a class instead of copy and paste my folders over and over again, Id go ahead and give it to you as well so that you don't have to worry about not understanding what the hell is going on just like me for the past couple of days. When you are writing a shell script you want to think about what you are going to need for your future projects. Do you need folders for photos, css?Java script? Well of course you do so you write down all the things you need and you make lines for each item (or put them all together on the same one) and you make sure you say exactly where you are going to put them. Once you have all those created spots you just need to add files into each one which is why we use the touch function so that we can touch that specific file without having to go deep inside the folder and write a command to get us right back out. Once you have all your folders and files created all you have to do is add the lines of code using an echo that you want to be inside of each of the files for future use and you are good to go. Whenever you need to use this shell script just put it into the terminal and hope to god that you said to put it in the correct area or you are going to be looking for a very long time where the hell you put it. Shell scripts are easy and fast ways to make a whole project file in less than a minute. Only issues that users may see from using this shell script may be that you need to keep the shell script in the home directory and do some terminal work to give it the correct permissions. Once you get everything all working though you have a decent basic shell script that can create new projects with the click of a button (and a few keyboard types). Make sure that you change the name of the project when you want to use it or else the next time you make a project it will just double the code that's in your index, css, and java files.
